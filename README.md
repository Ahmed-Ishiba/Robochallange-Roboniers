# Roboniers robochallange

documentation for our project in robochallange competetion line follower category with our amazing coaches alaa , adham mady 

## The thought that went into designing and programming our robot:

Firstly we were going to use a QTR sensor and a PID controller but we found it compilcating and time consuming so we switched to normal IR (infra red) sensor to sense the black line we then deigned to robot to make it as aerodynamic as possible to avoid the drag and lift forces and we were especially carfeul of the lift force as it made our robot bounce at the start of each trial  so we had to minimize the lift forces as it may affect the time in the trial and can lead to us losing 

## programming :

when it came to the programming which is the part i am responsible for i wrote a simple IR algorithm of 3 sensors located reletavily far from the center IR sensor and wrote simple conditions and debugged my code everytime i notice a problem while tryingout the robot this needed alot of trial and error to finnaly complete the programming but i did it nevertheless and after finishing the code i started working on improving the speed and modded my code to suit this speed this was not an easy task but we finally did it 

## components:

for the components we kept it fairly simple and bought the essentials here is a list:
- 3x IR sensor
- a cytron motor driver
- 12volt battery
- an STM32F103C8T6 blue pill module
- a caster wheel
- 2x 600RPM motors
- the miniQ wheels
and that was it all the components
